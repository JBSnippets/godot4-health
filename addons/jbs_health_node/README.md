# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JBSnippets/godot4-health/main/jbs_health_node_128.png" width="32" height="32" /> Health node ~ Godot 4+
A custom Godot 4+ node designed to store and update the health amount of a node, emitting signals based on health amount changes and set properties.

The node enables the addition of health capabilities, which can be adjusted by invoking the `update_amount` function. It can automatically send signals based on changes in the health amount and set properties.

## ðŸ§¬ Features
- Customizable health and maximum health values.
- Simplified connection to a `TextureProgressBar` and `ProgressBar` node as a health bar.
- Configurable auto-hide feature for the health bar.
- Option to switch from manual to automatic health update behavior.
- Ability to pause the automatic health update for a specified number of seconds.
- Ability to enable or disable damageable, healable, and revivable behaviors.
- Signals are emitted based on behavior, set properties, and updates to health amounts.
